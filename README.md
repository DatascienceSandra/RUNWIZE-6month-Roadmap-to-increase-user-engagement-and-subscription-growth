# RUNWIZE-6month-Roadmap-to-increase-user-engagement-and-subscription-growth
A product manager is the person who 
identifies the customer need and the larger 
business objectives that a product or feature 
will fulfill, articulates what success looks like 
for a product, and rallies a team to turn that 
vision into a reality (Sherif Mansour, Atlassian)


**The business opportunity **
RunWize has been in the market for just over a year and has 
an ambition to be the top fitness app in the UK. It has 
launched on both iOS and Android, available on 
smartwatches. 
Mission: Empower runners, transform lives, and create a 
vibrant community that thrives on health, resilience, and 
boundless achievement.
However, in the past three months the number of monthly 
app users has declined, as well as a churn of 10% in our paid 
subscribers since the start of this year. 
Business objective:
To enhance user engagement and subscription growth
Key Results: 
• Achieve a 15% increase in Monthly Average Users (MAU) 
within six months.
• Increase the paid subscriber count by 20% within six 
months.
